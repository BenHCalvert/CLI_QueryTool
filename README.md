## Welcome!
This is a Command Line Interface application that allows you to run queries on a fake dataset of student/school data. 

#### Getting Started

 TODO need instructions on getting data into DB and establishing DB connection -> insert these somewhere after step 3.
    change username and password in `index.js` (careful not to save this anywhere public, like Github.)
    first, run the scripts in `schema.sql`. Second, run the scripts in `dataLoad.sql`. You can do this in the MySQL command line client or in MySQL Workbench.  


1. Download this directory and open in your terminal.
2. You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. This app was built with v12.16.3.
3. You must have [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql) installed. Optionally, you can also install [MySQL workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) as a MySQL GUI.
3. run 
```npm install```
in your terminal to install all necessary node packages.
4. Now that you have all of that in place, You're ready to go! **Start the app** with
