## Welcome!
This is a command line application that allows you to run queries on a fake dataset of student/school data.


### Getting Started

1. Download this directory and open in your terminal.
2. You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. This app was built with v12.16.3.
3. You must have [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql) installed. Optionally, you can also install [MySQL workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) as a MySQL GUI.
4. Update your MySQL database host, port user and password in `conifg/connection.js` (careful not to save this anywhere public, like Github).
5. Run the scripts in `db/schema.sql`. Second, change the filepath to match the location of your .csv files and run the scripts in `db/dataLoad.sql`npm star. You can do this in the MySQL command line client or in MySQL Workbench. These will create the database, tables and import our dataset.
6. Run `npm install` in your terminal to install all necessary node packages.
7. Now that you have all of that in place, You're ready to go! **Start the app** with `npm start`.'
7. Use your arrow keys and return to select an option. All responses will be shown as JSON in the terminal.
